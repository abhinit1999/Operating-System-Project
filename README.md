Design a scheduler with multilevel queue having two queues which will schedule the processes on the basis of  pre-emptive shortest remaining processing time first algorithm (SROT) followed by a scheduling in which each process will get 2 units of time to execute. Also note that queue 1 has higher priority than queue 2.  Consider the following set of processes (for reference)with their arrival times and the CPU burst times in milliseconds.
-------------------------------------
Process  Arrival-Time   Burst-Time
-------------------------------------
P1             0      	       5
P2             1             	 3
P3             2               3
P4             4               1
-------------------------------------
Calculate the average turnaround time and average waiting time for each process. The input for number of processes  and their arrival time, burst time should be given by the user.
